```js
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";

const StateChanges = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  console.log("rerenders");
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <p>
        When a component’s state changes, it will re-render itself. Usually, it
        happens either in a callback or in useEffect hook. State changes are the
        “root” source of all re-renders.
      </p>
      <p>Click on the button and look at console.log</p>
      <div>Rerender {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click to Add</button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```
